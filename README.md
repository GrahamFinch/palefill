# Pale Moon Web Technologies Polyfill Add-On

Inject Polyfills for various web technologies into pages requiring them.

## Credits

This addon is heavily based on [**GitHub Web Components Polyfill**](https://github.com/JustOff/github-wc-polyfill), which does the same thing for GitHub, portions coming from there are `Copyright (c) 2020 JustOff.`

The polyfills themselves have different contributors, see `lib/polyfills.js`.
